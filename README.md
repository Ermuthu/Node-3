# Node-Project
My First Node Js Project 
based on Youtube Channel Playlist :https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYRpji8t4SxUkMxfowG4Kqphttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYRpji8t4SxUkMxfowG4Kqp
The Project's main idea is A user can login/Register to view his Articles or Other Users Articles .
only the Author may Edit/Delete his own Articles.
Learned in this Project :
*ExpressJs : A Node Js Framework that I found quite useful.
*Mongodb:A non sql DB ,json based documents.
*Passport : for Authentication.
